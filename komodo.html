           <I>Komodo dragon is a species of lizard native to the Indonesian islands 
           <BR> of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. 
            <br>It's known for being the largest living lizard species, growing up 
            <BR>to 3 meters (10 feet) in length and weighing as much 
            <br>as 70 kilograms (150 pounds). These reptiles are apex predators in 
           <BR> their habitats, primarily consuming deer, pigs, and occasionally 
            <br>even water buffalo. Komodo dragons have a venomous bite, which, combined 
           <BR> with their size and strength, allows them to hunt large prey. 
            <br>They are also known for their keen sense of smell and excellent vision, 
            <BR>which they use to locate food. Komodo dragons are classified as 
            <BR>vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 
           <BR> due to habitat loss, poaching, and human encroachment.</h4> </I>

                    <h4 align="left">
                    <br>1.Habitat: Komodo dragons are primarily found in the dry, tropical savannah forests and grasslands of the Indonesian islands where they are native. 
                    <br> These islands have a harsh and rugged terrain, which the dragons have adapted to over time.
                    <br>
                    <br>2.Physiology: Komodo dragons have long, muscular tails, strong legs with sharp claws, and a powerful, elongated head. Their skin is reinforced with 
                    <br>  scales, providing protection against injuries and allowing them to withstand the elements of their environment.
                     <br>
                     <br>3.Diet: These lizards are carnivorous and feed on a variety of prey including mammals, birds, and occasionally other reptiles. They are skilled hunters, 
                     <br> ambushing their prey and delivering a lethal bite with their serrated teeth and venomous saliva. After catching their prey, Komodo dragons will often tear 
                    <br>it apart and swallow it whole.
                    <br>
                    <br>4.Venom: While it was previously believed that Komodo dragons killed their prey through bacterial infection from their saliva, recent studies have shown that
                    <br>they do possess venom glands. The venom contains toxins that can lower blood pressure, induce shock, and prevent blood clotting, ultimately leading to the incapacitation
                     <br> of their prey.
                      <br>
                      <br>5.Reproduction: Komodo dragons reproduce through sexual reproduction, with females laying their eggs in nests dug into the ground. After an incubation period of about 7-8 months,
                      <br>the eggs hatch, and the young Komodo dragons emerge. The juveniles face a high mortality rate due to predation and cannibalism from adult dragons.
                      <br>Conservation: Due to threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and conflicts with humans, Komodo dragons are classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. Conservation efforts are underway 
                      <br>to protect their habitats and ensure their survival, including the establishment of protected areas and breeding programs.</h4>
