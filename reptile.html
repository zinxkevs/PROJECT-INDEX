        Komodo dragon, (Varanus komodoensis), largest extant lizard species. The dragon is a monitor lizard of the family Varanidae. 
            It occurs on Komodo Island and a few neighbouring islands of the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia. The popular interest in the 
            lizard’s large size and predatory habits has allowed this endangered species to become an ecotourist attraction, 
            which has encouraged its protection........<a href="komodo.html" target="_blank"><i>READ MORE</a></i>

        A member of the boa family, South America’s green anaconda is the heaviest snake in the world. Its cousin, the reticulated python, 
        can reach slightly greater lengths, but the enormous girth of the anaconda makes it almost twice as heavy.........<a href="anaconda.html" target="_blank"><I>READ MORE</a></I></h4>

        The leopard gecko is a popular beginner's reptile because it's easy to handle and requires minimal care compared to many other lizards. 
        Native to Afghanistan, Pakistan, northwest India, and Iran, leopard geckos have perky personalities and make movements that are interesting to watch. 
        They are commonly yellow, white, and spotted with black dots–hatchlings are striped and gradually change to the spotted appearance. There are several 
        colorful and patterned morphs or variations <a href="leopard.html" target="_blank"><I>READ MORE</a></I></h4>

            <h4 align="left">The king cobra—one of the most venomous snakes on the planet—can literally "stand up" and look a full-grown person in the eye. When confronted, they can lift 
                up to a third of its body off the ground and still move forward to attack.

                Fortunately, king cobras are shy and will avoid humans whenever possible. It will also flare out its iconic hood and emit a hiss that sounds almost like a growling dog.
                
                King cobras can reach 18 feet in length, making them the longest of all venomous snakes.<a href="cobra.html" target="_blank"><I>READ MORE</a></h4></I>
